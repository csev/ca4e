# Digital Circuit Editor - Command Line Interface

A sophisticated web-based digital circuit simulation and design tool with a powerful command line interface designed for accessibility and ease of use.

## üéØ Overview

This digital circuit editor allows users to create, simulate, and test digital logic circuits through both a visual interface and a command line interface. The command line interface is specifically designed to support users with limited vision, providing full keyboard control for building and testing circuits.

## üñ•Ô∏è Command Line Interface

The application includes a powerful command-line interface at the bottom of the screen, especially useful for accessibility and power users.

#### `delete [component-type] [label]`
Deletes a specific component by type and label.

**Examples:**

#### `connect [from] [from-connector] to [to] [to-connector]`
Connects two components using their input/output nodes.

**Connector Types:**
- **Simple Gates**: `input`, `input-1`, `input-2`, `output`, `output-1`, `output-2`
- **Complex Components**: Use labeled connectors (case-insensitive)

**Labeled Connectors by Component:**
- **Full Adder**: `Cin`, `A`, `B` (inputs); `S`, `Cout` (outputs)
- **Nixie Display**: `I1`, `I2`, `I4` (inputs); `O1`, `O2`, `O4` (outptuts)
- **3-bit Adder**: `A0`, `A1`, `A2`, `B0`, `B1`, `B2` (inputs); `S0`, `S1`, `S2`, `Cout` (outputs)
- **Clock Pulse**: `Hi`, `Lo` (outputs)
- **SR Flip-Flop**: `S`, `R`, `CLK` (inputs); `Q`, `Q'` (outputs)
- **JK Flip-Flop**: `J`, `K`, `CLK` (inputs); `Q`, `Q'` (outputs)
- **1-bit Latch**: `D`, `EN` (inputs); `Q` (output)
- **3-bit Latch**: `CLK`, `I1`, `I2`, `I3` (inputs); `O1`, `O2`, `O3` (outputs)

**Examples:**
- `connect a output to gate1 input-1` - Connects output of "a" to input-1 of "gate1"
- `connect sam output to full1 Cin` - Connects output of "sam" to Cin input of "full1"
- `connect full1 S to result input-1` - Connects S output of "full1" to input-1 of "result"
- `connect adder1 A0 to latch1 I1` - Connects A0 input of "adder1" to I1 input of "latch1"
- `connect counter1 output to nixie1 I1` - Connects output of "counter1" to I1 input of "nixie1"
- `connect clock1 Hi to flipflop1 CLK` - Connects Hi output of "clock1" to CLK input of "flipflop1"

#### `read`
Displays the current state of all components and their connections.

#### `read [component-label]`
Displays detailed information about a specific component, including:
- Component type and position
- Input and output connectors with their current values
- Connection status (connected/not connected)
- Special state information (for inputs, clocks, latches)
- Incoming and outgoing wire connections

**Examples:**
- `read` - Shows all components and connections
- `read full1` - Shows detailed info about component "full1"
- `read clock1` - Shows detailed info about component "clock1"

#### `clear`
Removes all components and wires from the canvas.

#### `layout`
**NEW!** Automatically optimizes component layout to minimize wire crossings and improve readability. This command uses advanced algorithms including:

- **Force-directed layout** - Components repel each other while connected components attract
- **Level-based positioning** - Components are arranged by their logical depth from inputs
- **Wire crossing minimization** - Detects and reduces wire intersections
- **Clean wire routing** - Removes existing waypoints for direct, clean connections
- **Grid snapping** - Aligns components to a grid for cleaner appearance

**Note:** If existing waypoints are detected, a confirmation dialog will appear asking permission to remove them before layout optimization.

**Examples:**
- `layout` - Optimizes the current circuit layout

#### `help`
Displays detailed help information for all available commands.
