# Digital Circuit Editor - Command Line Interface

A sophisticated web-based digital circuit simulation and design tool with a powerful command line interface designed for accessibility and ease of use.

## üéØ Overview

This digital circuit editor allows users to create, simulate, and test digital logic circuits through both a visual interface and a command line interface. The command line interface is specifically designed to support users with limited vision, providing full keyboard control for building and testing circuits.

## üñ•Ô∏è Command Line Interface

The application includes a powerful command-line interface at the bottom of the screen, especially useful for accessibility and power users.

### Available Commands

#### `place [component-type] [optional-label]`
Places a component on the canvas. If a label is provided, it uses the literal label; otherwise, it uses automatic numbering.

**Component Types:**
- `input` - Input gate
- `output` - Output gate  
- `and` - AND gate
- `or` - OR gate
- `not` - NOT gate
- `nand` - NAND gate
- `nor` - NOR gate
- `xor` - XOR gate
- `full-adder` - Full adder
- `nixie` - Nixie tube display
- `clock` - Clock generator
- `sr-flip-flop` - SR flip-flop
- `jk-flip-flop` - JK flip-flop
- `1-bit-latch` - 1-bit latch
- `3-bit-latch` - 3-bit latch
- `3-bit-adder` - 3-bit adder

**Examples:**
- `place input a` - Places an input labeled "a"
- `place and` - Places an AND gate with automatic numbering
- `place or gate1` - Places an OR gate labeled "gate1"

#### `delete [component-type] [label]`
Deletes a specific component by type and label.

**Examples:**
- `delete input a` - Deletes input labeled "a"
- `delete and gate1` - Deletes AND gate labeled "gate1"

#### `connect [from] [from-connector] to [to] [to-connector]`
Connects two components using their input/output nodes.

**Examples:**
- `connect a output to gate1 input-1` - Connects output of "a" to input-1 of "gate1"
- `connect gate1 output to result input-1` - Connects output of "gate1" to input-1 of "result"

#### `read`
Displays the current state of all components and their connections.

#### `clear`
Removes all components and wires from the canvas.

#### `layout`
**NEW!** Automatically optimizes component layout to minimize wire crossings and improve readability. This command uses advanced algorithms including:

- **Force-directed layout** - Components repel each other while connected components attract
- **Level-based positioning** - Components are arranged by their logical depth from inputs
- **Wire crossing minimization** - Detects and reduces wire intersections
- **Clean wire routing** - Removes existing waypoints for direct, clean connections
- **Grid snapping** - Aligns components to a grid for cleaner appearance

**Note:** If existing waypoints are detected, a confirmation dialog will appear asking permission to remove them before layout optimization.

**Examples:**
- `layout` - Optimizes the current circuit layout

#### `help`
Displays detailed help information for all available commands.
