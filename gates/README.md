# Digital Circuit Editor - Command Line Interface

A sophisticated web-based digital circuit simulation and design tool with a powerful command line interface designed for accessibility and ease of use.

## üéØ Overview

This digital circuit editor allows users to create, simulate, and test digital logic circuits through both a visual interface and a command line interface. The command line interface is specifically designed to support users with limited vision, providing full keyboard control for building and testing circuits.

## üñ•Ô∏è Command Line Interface

The command line interface is located at the bottom of the screen and provides text-based control over all circuit operations.

### Basic Commands

#### `place [component-type] [optional-label]`
Places a component on the canvas with smart positioning to avoid overlapping.

**Examples:**
```bash
place input a          # Places input with label "a"
place and gate1        # Places AND gate with label "gate1"
place or              # Places OR gate with automatic numbering (OR1)
place not inverter    # Places NOT gate with label "inverter"
```

**Available Component Types:**
- `input` - Input signal source
- `output` - Output signal destination
- `and` - AND gate
- `or` - OR gate
- `not` - NOT gate (inverter)
- `nand` - NAND gate
- `nor` - NOR gate
- `xor` - XOR gate
- `full-adder` - 1-bit full adder
- `nixie` - Nixie display
- `clock` - Clock pulse generator
- `sr-flip-flop` - SR flip-flop
- `jk-flip-flop` - JK flip-flop
- `1-bit-latch` - 1-bit latch
- `3-bit-latch` - 3-bit latch
- `3-bit-adder` - 3-bit adder

#### `delete [component-type] [label]`
Deletes a specific component and all its connections.

**Examples:**
```bash
delete input a         # Deletes input with label "a"
delete and gate1       # Deletes AND gate with label "gate1"
delete or OR1          # Deletes OR gate with label "OR1"
```

#### `connect [from] [from-connector] to [to] [to-connector]`
Connects components using their input and output connectors.

**Examples:**
```bash
connect a output to gate1 input-1      # Connects input "a" to first input of "gate1"
connect gate1 output to gate2 input-1  # Connects "gate1" output to "gate2" first input
connect clock output-1 to latch input-1 # Connects first output of clock to first input of latch
```

**Connector Types:**
- `output` - First output (for single-output components)
- `output-1`, `output-2`, etc. - Specific outputs (for multi-output components)
- `input` - First input (for single-input components)
- `input-1`, `input-2`, etc. - Specific inputs (for multi-input components)

#### `read`
Displays the current circuit status including:
- All components and their positions
- All connections between components
- Current state of inputs and outputs

**Example Output:**
```
Circuit Status:

Components:
- a (INPUT) at (400, 300)
- gate1 (AND) at (500, 300)
- result (OUTPUT) at (600, 300)

Connections:
- a output to gate1 input-1
- gate1 output to result input-1

Circuit State:
- a: 0
- result: 0
```

#### `clear`
Removes all components and connections from the circuit.

#### `help`
Displays available commands and usage examples.
