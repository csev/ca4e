In-Browser WASM Editing, Assembly, and Execution
------------------------------------------------

This is a teaching tool that will allow students to be presented with a 
simple bit of WASM with the code needed to print("hello world").  The WASM
will be presented in a text aread and can be edited.  When the user
finishes editing and runs the WASM, it will be run and the output will be in
a div.
