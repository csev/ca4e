I want to write a book titles "Computer Architecture for Everybody" and publish it on KDP.  I am most interested in a PDF and HTML output - EPUB is secondary.   What is the best format to write the book and how do yuo produce a print ready PDF that will pass KDP input validation.

I want to have you help me create the first draft of a textbook based on my Computer Architecture for Everybody.  The publishing tool chain will be Markdown → Pandoc → XeLaTeX → PDF.

I am writing a book titled “Computer Architecture for Everybody.”
This chapter should be written in clear, friendly, technically accurate prose, suitable for motivated beginners and early CS students, with light historical context and intuitive explanations.

I will upload:
a PDF of lecture slides
one or more SBV caption files from recorded lectures
Please use these materials to draft one complete book chapter in Markdown, not a transcript, but a well-structured narrative explanation.

✍️ Writing Style and Goals

Use conceptual explanations, not lecture narration.
Assume the reader is curious but not yet technical.  This might be their first course in technology
but more likey they will have some programming background Keep my teaching voice: friendly, slightly
conversational, occasionally humorous, but precise.

Include light historical or motivational context where appropriate.  The story arc is important - it should be an enjoyable
read where the reader is looking forward to what is coming next.

We want to communicate high level concepts - write for retention and understanding, not gory 
detail.  Although tables of different kinds of technologies or similar material is helpful.

Do not reference the existence of slides or videos in the text.

🧱 Chapter Structure

Please structure the chapter as:

Chapter title

Short opening motivation / story

Sections that follow the conceptual flow of the lectures

Occasional callout boxes (formatted as blockquotes) for:

historical notes

“why this matters”

Short summary section at the end

Optional preview of what comes next

Use standard Markdown headings:

# Chapter Title
## Section
### Subsection

🖼 Figures and Diagrams

When the material clearly implies a figure or diagram, insert a placeholder like:

![Placeholder: diagram of transistor switching](images/ch01-transistor.png)

Do not invent detailed visuals; just indicate where they would help.

🧪 Code and Technical Detail
Include code or pseudo-code only when it clearly helps understanding.
Keep it simple and readable.
Prefer explanations over formal definitions.
🔍 How to Use the Inputs
Use the slides to determine structure and key concepts.
Use the SBV to capture phrasing, emphasis, and transitions.
Resolve inconsistencies by favoring conceptual clarity over exact wording.
Remove filler, repetition, and lecture artifacts.
📄 Output Requirements
Output only the chapter in Markdown.
Do not include meta commentary, outlines, or explanations of your process.
The result should be suitable for direct inclusion in a Pandoc book build.
Please favor continuous narrative paragraphs over bullet-style exposition, and explicitly connect ideas with cause-and-effect transitions so the chapter reads like a story rather than a lecture outline.
