Instruction set foe the CDC8512

SX3 A3      # Copy a register to another
SX3 42      # Set a register to an 8-bit constant (Base-10, single character or 0x hex)
INC A1      # Add 1 to a register
DEC X3      # Subtract 1 from a register
ADD X1, 42  # Add a constant to a register
SUB X3, 42  # Subtract a constant from a register
CMP X3, 42  # Compare a register to a constant and set comparison status
JP 0x12     # Jump to a label
JL 0x12     # Jump to the label if the previous comparison was "less than"
JE 0x12     # Jump to the label if the previous comparison was equal
JG 0x12     # Jump to the label if the previous comparison was "greater than"
PS          # Print data area as zero-terminated character string on a single line
DI          # Dump Instruction area in hex 16 per line - stop after two successive zeros are encountered in an output line
DD          # Dump data area in hex 16 per line - stop after two successive zeros are encountered in an output line
DC          # Print CPU
RESET       # Set data memory to zero, set all registers to zero, continue executing 
HALT        # Stop Execution
