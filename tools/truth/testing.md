# Logic Truth Table Challenge – Testing Checklist

## Setup
- [ ] Launch the tool from Tsugi (LTI context) and confirm that the page loads without console errors.
- [ ] Verify that the instructor dashboard link appears only for instructor launches.
- [ ] Toggle reduced-motion in the OS/browser and ensure no animations play.

## Gameplay
- [ ] Confirm that the displayed gate name matches the schematic.
- [ ] Fill in a correct truth table; ensure the score increments by 1 and the feedback turns positive.
- [ ] Enter an incorrect value; verify that the field is outlined in red and feedback indicates the error.
- [ ] Leave a blank cell and tab away; confirm the feedback prompts you to complete all entries.
- [ ] Ensure automatic focus jumps to the next blank when a correct value is entered.
- [ ] Toggle auto-advance off; finish a table and check that the timer does not start and the feedback invites a manual next step.
- [ ] With auto-advance on, complete a table and confirm the five-second countdown appears in the button text.
- [ ] Click “Next table” during an active countdown to verify the timer cancels immediately.
- [ ] Confirm that gates cycle without repeating the same gate twice in a row.

## Scoring & Grade Submission
- [ ] Accumulate 10 correct tables and ensure the score caps at 10.
- [ ] Verify that an alert appears indicating a 1.0 grade was sent to the LMS.
- [ ] Check the LMS gradebook (or Tsugi gradebook) to confirm the score submission.
- [ ] Continue playing and ensure no additional grade submissions occur.

## Accessibility
- [ ] Navigate the truth table solely via keyboard (Tab, Shift+Tab, Arrow keys).
- [ ] Confirm that the aria-live feedback is read by a screen reader after each state change.
- [ ] Inspect the page with high-contrast mode or low-vision zoom—text remains legible and controls usable.

## Instructor Dashboard
- [ ] Open the instructor dashboard; ensure assignments and due-date settings display correctly.
- [ ] Visit the grades table and launch analytics via the dashboard links.
