# Gates Tool Testing Plan

## Overview
This document outlines comprehensive testing procedures for the Gates tool, including UI validation, error detection, assignment functionality, and easter egg testing.

## Test Environment Setup
1. Access the tool via LTI launch at the /tools URL or direct URL at /tools/toolname
2. Ensure you have instructor privileges for easter egg testing
3. Have multiple browser tabs/windows ready for different test scenarios

   - Configure `HalfAdderExercise` assignment
   - Open assignment modal
   - Start grading process

2. **Easter Egg Activation**
   - Press `Ctrl + *`
   - Verify console message: "üéØ Easter egg triggered! Ctrl + * detected! (Half adder reference!)"
   - Verify circuit automatically appears with:
     - Input A and Input B components
     - XOR gate for SUM output
     - AND gate for CARRY output
     - Output S and C components
     - All necessary wire connections

3. **Grading with Easter Egg**
   - With easter egg circuit in place, continue grading
   - Verify all grading steps pass:
     - Component placement verification
     - Wire connection verification
     - Logic functionality verification
   - Verify grade submission works
   - Verify success message appears

4. **Non-Instructor Test**
   - Test as student user (non-instructor)
   - Press `Ctrl + *`
   - Verify easter egg does NOT activate
   - Verify console message: "‚ùå Half adder Easter egg attempted by anonymous user"

#### Test Steps for Full Adder (FullAdderExercise):

1. **Setup**
   - Configure `FullAdderExercise` assignment
   - Open assignment modal
   - Start grading process

2. **Easter Egg Activation**
   - Press `Ctrl + +`
   - Verify console message: "üéØ Easter egg triggered! Ctrl + + detected! (Full adder reference - ironic!)"
   - Verify circuit automatically appears with:
     - Input A, B, and Cin components
     - Two XOR gates (for A‚äïB and final SUM)
     - Two AND gates (for carry logic)
     - One OR gate (for final carry)
     - Output S and Cout components
     - All necessary wire connections

3. **Grading with Easter Egg**
   - With easter egg circuit in place, continue grading
   - Verify all grading steps pass:
     - Component placement verification
     - Wire connection verification
     - Logic functionality verification
   - Verify grade submission works

### 4. Manual Circuit Building Testing
**Purpose**: Verify normal circuit building functionality works correctly.

#### Test Steps:
1. **Component Placement**
   - Place various logic gates (AND, OR, XOR, NOT, NAND, NOR)
   - Place input and output components
   - Verify components appear correctly
   - Verify component labels and connections

2. **Wire Connections**
   - Connect components with wires
   - Verify wire routing works
   - Verify connections are valid
   - Test multiple input connections

3. **Circuit Simulation**
   - Test circuit with different input combinations
   - Verify output behavior matches expected logic
   - Verify simulation runs without errors
