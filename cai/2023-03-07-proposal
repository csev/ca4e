Working Project Title:

Computer Architecture for Everybody

Faculty Lead and Instructional Team:

Dr. Charles R. Severance

Brief Description:

This course is a high level coverage of Computer Architecture to help students become programmers. The outline of topics is: 
(1) Transistors and solid state electronics
(2) Building simple logic gates
(3) Simple circuit layout - building chips with photolithography
(4) CPUs Architecture and Instruction Sets
(5) Machine language (0's and 1's)
(6) Assembly Language

This material feels too small to be a four course specialization so I think the best for will be a 6-8 week single course (kind of like Internet History Technology, and Security)

Timeline (optional):

I hope to develop the material over Summer 2024 and start with the CAI process in Fall 2024.
